# Python Implementation of Recommendation ITU-R P.1812

This code repository contains a python software implementation of  [Recommendation ITU-R P.1812-6](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.1812/en) with a path-specific propagation prediction method for point-to-area terrestrial services in the frequency range 30 MHz to 6000 MHz.  

This is a development code and it is not necessarily in line with the original reference [MATLAB/Octave Implementation of Recommendation ITU-R P.1812](https://github/eeveetza/p1812) approved by ITU-R Working Party 3M and published on [ITU-R SG 3 Software, Data, and Validation Web Page](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/Pages/iono-tropo-spheric.aspx).

The package can be downloaded and installed using:
~~~
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/eeveetza/Py1812@dev#egg=Py1812"  
~~~

and imported as follows
~~~
from Py1812 import P1812

## Function Call

The function `P1812.bt_loss` can be called

1. by invoking only the required input arguments:
~~~ 
Lb, Ep = P1812.bt_loss (f, p, d, h, R, Ct, zone, htg, hrg, pol, phi_t,  phi_r,  lam_t,  lam_r)
~~~
1. by invoking both the required and optional input arguments (the latter can be invoked in any order as key = value pairs):
~~~
Lb, Ep = P1812.bt_loss(f, p, d, h, R, Ct, zone, htg, hrg, pol, phi_t, phi_r, lam_t, lam_r, \
            pL = val_pL, sigmaL = val_sigmaL, Ptx = val_Ptx, DN = val_DN, N0 = val_N0 \
            dct = val_dct, dcr = val_dcr, flag4 = val_flag4, debug = val_debug, fid_log = val_fid_log)
